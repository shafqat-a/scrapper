# Tasks: Provider-Based Web Scraping System (Python)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-read-spec-md/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (Python 3.11+), research.md (Scrapy/Playwright stack), data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: Python 3.11+, Scrapy, Playwright, Pydantic, Click, SQLAlchemy
   → Structure: Single Python package with src/scraper_core/, src/providers/, src/cli/
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 6 core entities → Pydantic model tasks
   → contracts/provider-interfaces.py: Provider protocols → contract test tasks
   → contracts/workflow.schema.json: JSON schema → validation test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 3 user scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate Python-specific tasks:
   → Setup: Poetry project, dependencies, pre-commit hooks
   → Tests: pytest contract tests, integration tests with Docker
   → Core: Pydantic models, provider implementations, workflow engine
   → Integration: CLI with Click, logging, error handling
   → Polish: unit tests, documentation, performance validation
4. Apply TDD constitutional requirements:
   → All pytest tests before implementation (RED phase required)
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Real dependencies in integration tests (Docker containers)
5. Validate completeness: All provider protocols tested, all entities modeled
```

- Tests before implementation is constitutional requirement

### Implementation Dependencies
- Pydantic models (T029-T034) block provider implementations (T038-T043)
- Base classes (T035-T037) block provider implementations (T038-T043)
- Provider implementations block workflow engine (T044-T047)
- Workflow engine blocks CLI implementation (T048-T052)
- Core implementation blocks integration (T053-T061)

## Constitutional Compliance Validation

### TDD Requirements ✅
- [ ] All contract tests (T007-T028) written before any implementation
- [ ] Tests must fail initially (RED phase enforced)
- [ ] Real dependencies in integration tests (Docker containers)
- [ ] pytest used for all testing

### Library-First Architecture ✅
- [ ] Core functionality in src/scraper_core/ as library
- [ ] Provider system in src/providers/ as separate modules
- [ ] CLI in src/cli/ as interface layer
- [ ] Each component pip-installable

### Provider Pattern ✅
- [ ] Pluggable scraping providers (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Playwright)
- [ ] Pluggable storage providers (CSV, PostgreSQL, JSON)
- [ ] Protocol-based interfaces with abstract base classes
- [ ] Dynamic provider loading and registration

### Python Best Practices ✅
- [ ] Type hints throughout (mypy validation)
- [ ] Pydantic models for all data validation
- [ ] AsyncIO for concurrent operations
- [ ] Click for CLI with Rich output formatting
- [ ] Poetry for modern dependency management

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All provider protocols have contract tests (T007-T017)
- [x] All data model entities have Pydantic implementations (T029-T034)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T007-T028 before T029+)
- [x] Parallel tasks operate on different files
- [x] Each task specifies exact Python file path
- [x] Constitutional TDD requirements enforced
- [x] Integration tests use real Docker containers
- [x] CLI provides --help/--version/--format options

## Notes

### Python-Specific Considerations
- Use `asyncio` for all I/O operations
- Implement proper `__init__.py` files for package structure
- Follow PEP 8 style guide (enforced by black)
- Use `tenacity` for retry logic with exponential backoff
- Integrate with `fake-useragent` for anti-detection

### Testing Strategy
- Contract tests validate protocol compliance
- Integration tests use Docker containers for real backends
- Unit tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows
- Performance tests ensure <2s execution for simple workflows

### Development Workflow
- Poetry for dependency management (`poetry install`, `poetry build`)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- mypy for static type checking
- pytest with coverage reporting
- Black for code formatting

**Total Tasks**: 75 (Setup: 6, Contract Tests: 22, Implementation: 30, Integration: 8, Polish: 9)
