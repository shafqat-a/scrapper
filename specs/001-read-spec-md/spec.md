# Feature Specification: Provider-Based Web Scraping System

**Feature Branch**: `001-read-spec-md`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Read spec.md at project root folder for specification"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst, I want to configure and run web scraping workflows through JSON definitions so that I can collect data from different websites using appropriate scraping strategies without writing custom code for each site.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JSON workflow file is configured for a specific website, **When** the system processes the workflow, **Then** it should initialize, discover data, extract content, handle pagination, and store results using the specified storage provider
2. **Given** multiple pages exist on a target website, **When** the scraping process runs, **Then** it should automatically navigate through available pages and collect data from each
3. **Given** a workflow specifies a storage provider (CSV, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), **When** data extraction completes, **Then** the system should save the collected data in the specified format/location
4. **Given** post-processing steps are defined in the workflow, **When** data extraction completes, **Then** the system should apply the specified transformations before storage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a target website structure changes and existing selectors no longer work?
- How does the system handle websites with anti-scraping measures or rate limiting?
- What occurs when pagination logic encounters unexpected page structures?
- How are errors handled during data extraction or storage operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support a provider-based architecture for different scraping strategies per website
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute workflows defined in JSON format with configurable command steps
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform initialization by navigating to target website URLs and scanning page structure
- **FR-004**: System MUST discover and identify available data elements on web pages
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract identified data elements from web pages
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle pagination by navigating to additional pages when available
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple storage providers (CSV, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow optional post-processing steps for data transformation and cleanup
- **FR-009**: System MUST execute workflow steps as independent, composable commands
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to define custom workflows through JSON configuration files
- **FR-011**: System MUST support pluggable scraping providers for different website types
- **FR-012**: System MUST support pluggable storage providers for flexible data persistence

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow**: JSON-based configuration defining the complete scraping process for a specific website or data source
- **Scraping Provider**: Pluggable component that implements website-specific scraping logic and strategies
- **Storage Provider**: Pluggable component that handles data persistence to various storage backends
- **Command**: Individual workflow step that performs a specific action (init, discovery, extraction, pagination, post-processing)
- **Data Element**: Individual piece of information extracted from a web page (text, links, images, structured data)
- **Page Context**: Current state of the scraping session including URL, page structure, and navigation history
