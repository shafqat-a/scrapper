## Development Notes

This release represents the successful completion of a Test-Driven Development approach:
- **RED Phase**: Comprehensive test suite with failing tests (T022-T028)
- **GREEN Phase**: Implementation of all components to pass tests (T029-T048)
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Code quality improvements and optimization

The system is now production-ready and suitable for real-world web scraping workflows.
